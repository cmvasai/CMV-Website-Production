When renowned musicians performed to support Chinmaya Mission projects, he swayed and tapped in rhythm, fully immersed in the divine vibrations. He regarded listening to Indian classical music as a form of meditation. He observed, \"Music is an ornamentation of Silence and should be used by seekers to experience the silence within, in our quest towards Oneness with our Divine Self.\" Rooted in the Samaveda and Natyashastra, Indian classical music is more than an artâ€”it is a science of sound and vibration. Through carefully composed shlokas and stutis, it uplifts the spirit and spreads positivity."

Emphasising the importance of systematic reflection (Mananam), Gurudev encouraged this practice to internalise spiritual knowledge. A year later, the first formal Study Group was formed in Chennai, marking the beginning of Chinmaya Mission as an organised movement. Today, these groups have grown into a global network of seekers, united in the pursuit of self-knowledge. Devi Groups, introduced in 1958, are Study Groups exclusively for women. Created with Gurudev's blessings, they offer a nurturing space for scriptural study, devotional practices and cultural upliftment. Together, Study Groups and Devi Groups serve as the grassroots foundation of Chinmaya Mission's enduring vision: a spiritually awakened society, grounded in timeless values."

These offerings are thoughtfully adapted to diverse cultural and regional contexts, yet firmly rooted in the unchanging vision of Vedanta. Chinmaya Mission sees later years of life not as a decline, but as an opportunity to shift awareness towards inner growth. As put by Swami Tejomayananda, \"Ageing is not decaying; it is maturing for the inward journey. It is the birth into empowerment - leaving the world of dependency on objects and relationships.\" CCVS programmes offer practical tools and answers to the real-life questions of the elderly through workshops, study groups, Vedanta classes, retreats, spiritual mentoring and community engagement. They empower Seniors to: Balance action and rest with inner wisdom, Cultivate meaningful relationships within a like-minded community, Embrace spiritual growth as the central goal of life's final chapters."
